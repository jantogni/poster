% on making postscript, resizeing, and printing the poster file
% please see web site 
% http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~pjh/posters/poster_howto.html
% 
% N.B. This format is cribbed from one obtained from the University
% of Karlsruhe, so some macro names and parameters are in German
% Here is a short glosary:
% Breite: width
% Hoehe: height
% sPALTE: column
% Kasten: box
%
% All style files necessary are part of standard TeTeX distribution
% On the UF unix cluster you should not need to import these files
% specially, as they will be automatically located.  If you
% run on a local PC however, you will need to locate these files.
% At UF try /usr/local/TeTeX...

% The recommended procedure is to first generate a ``Special Format" size poster
% file, which is relatively easy to manipulate and view.  It can be
% resized later to A0 (900 x 1100 mm) full poster size, or A4 or Letter size
% as desired (see web site).  Note the large format printers currently
% in use at UF's OIR have max width of about 90cm or 3 ft., but the paper
% comes in rolls so the length is variable.  See below the specifications
% for width and height of various formats.  Default in the template is
% ``Special Format",  with 4 columns.

The success of an observatory is usually measured by its impact in the
scientific community, so a common objective is to provide transparent ways to
access the generated data. The Chilean Virtual Observatory (ChiVO), started
working in the implementation of a prototype, in collaboration with ALMA,
considering the current needs of the Chilean astronomical community, in
addition to the protocols and standards of IVOA, and the comparison of
different existing data access toolkit services. Based on this efforts, a VO
prototype was designed and implemented for the ALMA large scale of data.

		\begin{minipage}[t]{0.85\linewidth}
			Over time, observatories will start generating better quality data, in
			computational terms, with data sets in the order of the Tera- and Petabytes
			produced each year. This creates a series of problems, such as the
			distribution, access and processing of the data. This phenomena is known as
			"Astronomical Data Avalanche".
			
			In this context, the Chilean Virtual Observatory currently collaborates with
			ALMA observatory to promote compatible services with protocols and standards
			set by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). IVOA is an
			organization that discusses and sets the technical norms necessary to make a VO
			possible.
			
			Providing a web service under these conditions imposes a series of
			difficulties: capture and analyze the "use cases" and the requirements of an
			online data access platform; compare these needs to the IVOA protocols and
			standards; and finally implement a functional prototype that fulfills the
			previous requirements.

			The ChiVO is a virtual observatory under construction
			that will host the data of the observatories located in Chile, adhered to the
			interoperability standards of the International Virtual Observatories Alliance
			(IVOA), and using last generation technologies.  Broadly, the architecture has
			three layers: \emph{Users}:  astronomers and scientists in general, interested
			in the data published by the observatories; \emph{Resources}: observatories and
			centres producing astronomical data (real or simulated); \emph{Intermediate
			layer}: defines what a virtual observatory is; that is, how users and resources
			communicate using protocols and standards to search and accees data.

                        %The test that was run on the FrontEnd receiver consisted in locking the band in 0.5\,[GHz] steps over the range of
                        %the four available bands. The test took approximately 4 hours, time during which the sampling system GUI was

			\begin{minipage}[t]{0.50\linewidth}
Despite the amount of data generated by observatories in Chile, there was no VO
a year ago, and particularly, ALMA at the moment does not have services
compatible with VO. The implementation of the ChiVO caused a series of
complications that arise from the understanding of the needs of the
astronomers, and how these are translated to data systems and services, using
IVOA international regulations.

The approach of the current development is focused on incremental prototypes,
thus generating frequent deliverables to the system users (Astronomers) who are
pleased by the progress made. However, there are always things to implement, or
new ideas coming up. So far it has been possible to capture the astronomers
requirements, and to address the study of the protocols and standards, 
thus creating the data access services (SCS, SIA, SSA, TAP); 

			\end{minipage} \hspace{0.2cm}
			\begin{minipage}[t]{0.50\linewidth}

these have access to the data base that use a relational data model (ObsCore),
subjected to their own ChiVO architecture, which enables the interoperability
of the services.

Currently, the prototype is in its first delivery, and by mid-2014 it will be
launched its second iteration, which will include the public data of the cycle
0 of ALMA. Hence, more users will be familiarized with the system, having the
chance to test in situ the current functionalities and limitations of the
implementations. For the following versions it is considered the
implementation of other IVOA architecture protocols, as the section of Registry
and standards of access to resources, as VOSPace [1]. %\cite{graham2007vospace}.
Regarding the models and multidimensional data, as the ALMA cubes, it will be
necessary to work in the creation or adaptation of the IVOA standards.
